I am a Software Engineering Manager with a strong foundation in full-stack development and a passion for building scalable, secure, and impactful software. I lead cross-functional engineering teams across countries and cultures to deliver reliable SaaS platforms, working closely with stakeholders to align product and technical goals.

With 5 years and 3 months of experience as an Individual Contributor, followed by 4 years and 6 months in engineering team leadership roles. My experience spans backend architecture, system integration, infrastructure planning, and CI/CD workflows. I remain hands-on in solving complex engineering challenges and providing technical guidance across the development lifecycle. I also led the end-to-end ISO 27001 certification process, integrating security and compliance into our engineering practices.

I am known for empowering engineers, fostering a culture of ownership, collaboration, and agility, and bridging the gap between business vision and technical execution. Whether mentoring team members or collaborating with clients, I focus on driving outcomes that matter.

I always happy to connect and collaborate. Let's build the future together!
