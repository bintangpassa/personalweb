I am a Software Engineering Manager with 9+ years in the tech industry, including 5+ years leading engineering teams and 5+ years building secure, scalable SaaS platforms across multiple companies and industries.

In my current role at a Transport Management SaaS company serving clients across the APAC region, I lead distributed teams across Indonesia, Singapore (HQ), and the Philippines, while closely collaborating with cross-functional teams in Malaysia. I work closely with stakeholders to align product and technical goals, and actively facilitate Agile processes and Scrum ceremonies to ensure iterative delivery, team alignment, and continuous improvement.

I also led the end-to-end ISO 27001 certification process, embedding security and compliance into our engineering practices and culture.

My overall experience spans backend and frontend development, end-to-end architecture, system integration, infrastructure planning, and CI/CD workflows. As a hands-on leader, I support engineers through architectural guidance, technical problem-solving, and mentorship.

I’m always happy to connect and collaborate. let’s build the future together!
