As a Back end Developer, I was responsible for creating the backend system of the official portal for the Indonesian Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries. Using CodeIgniter and MySQL, I developed core features, managed database interactions, and ensured API connectivity with a separately developed front end. I collaborated closely with external developers to deliver a stable and integrated platform that served both public and administrative users.

In addition to the government portal, I was also involved in the development of a hospital information system platform and several other web-based projects. These experiences expanded my understanding of domain-specific requirements, especially in terms of system reliability, data security, and user access control. I consistently focused on building clean and maintainable code while contributing to multiple stages of the development lifecycle, from design to deployment.
