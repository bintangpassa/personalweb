As a System Administrator Intern, I assisted in managing and maintaining several internal systems and basic server infrastructure. My responsibilities included monitoring system performance, performing routine maintenance, supporting user access and configuration, and helping ensure the availability of web-based services used by the agency. This role strengthened my foundational skills in system administration, server maintenance, and operational support in a government environment.
