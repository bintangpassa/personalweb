During my internship at Indosat Ooredoo, I worked as a Fullstack Developer Intern within the telecommunications industry. I developed an internal web application for mapping and analyzing the competitive landscape of telco products, supporting internal teams with market research and strategic positioning. The system was built using PHP and MySQL, with a focus on data accessibility, content manageability, and user-friendly presentation.
