At this company, I worked as a Software Engineer focusing on payment gateway solutions and banking related platforms. One of my key projects involved contributing to the development of a web based FSCM (Financial Supply Chain Management) internet banking platform (AksesBisnis BTPN Bank) supporting business clients in managing payments, collections, and reconciliations. The system was built using Zend Framework with a MySQL backend, and I was responsible for implementing secure backend features, user interface logic, and data integration workflows.

Beyond development, I supported senior engineers in managing deployments and production rollouts in banking environments, which required strict procedural compliance and coordination. These deployments often took place outside regular hours, typically aligned with banking EOD (End of Day) schedules so I became very familiar with midnight rollouts and detailed change control processes. This experience strengthened my attention to detail, sense of responsibility, and ability to deliver under regulatory and operational pressure.
