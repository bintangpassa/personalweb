PT. Square Gate One provides solutions for both payment gateway and banking-related platforms. During my time there, I focused specifically on banking system projects. One of my key responsibilities was contributing as a Full Stack Engineer to the development of a web-based FSCM (Financial Supply Chain Management) internet banking platform (AksesBisnis BTPN Bank), supporting business clients in managing payments, collections, and reconciliations. The system was built using the Zend Framework and a SQL-based database. I was responsible for maintaining existing features, implementing system updates, and developing new functionality across both backend logic and user-facing components. The platform was integrated with the bank’s middleware systems, including message streams via Apache Kafka provided by the bank. We used Subversion (SVN) for version control throughout the development lifecycle.

Beyond development, I supported senior engineers in managing deployments and production rollouts in banking environments. These deployments were conducted in close coordination with engineers from the bank’s internal team and followed strict procedural and compliance standards. Rollouts were typically performed outside regular working hours, aligned with banking EOD (End of Day) schedules. This experience strengthened my attention to detail, sense of responsibility, and ability to deliver within regulated, high-stakes environments.
