As a Senior Full Stack Developer, I designed and developed robust, scalable solutions for a high-traffic Learning Management System (LMS), supporting thousands of simultaneous users across Singapore and other APAC markets.

I was responsible for both frontend and backend development, with a strong focus on performance optimization and code quality. One of my key contributions was leading a major refactoring initiative and migrating the codebase from CodeIgniter to Laravel. This significantly improved code maintainability, developer experience, and enabled faster feature delivery.

I also contributed to the development of video and image-based learning features, allowing educators to incorporate multimedia content into lesson modules and assessments. This enhanced engagement and flexibility in delivering personalized learning experiences.

Working in a lean engineering team, I ensured the platform remained responsive and reliable under high load while introducing modern development practices and modular structure. My efforts directly contributed to improved system stability, faster development cycles, and increased user satisfaction.
