As a Software Engineer in a fast paced product team, I was involved in developing and maintaining over five in house web platforms across various business domains, including HRIS, Point of Sale (POS), B2B platforms, marketplace systems, warehouse management systems (WMS), and job vacancy portals. Each project had unique business logic and architecture requirements, giving me the opportunity to design flexible backends and intuitive user experiences tailored to different industries.

Most of the platforms were built using Laravel and MySQL, and I was deeply involved in the full development cycle from gathering requirements and designing database schemas to implementing features, writing unit tests, and deploying to production. I also collaborated closely with designers, QA engineers, and product managers to ensure timely delivery and high quality output. This experience honed my adaptability and broadened my understanding of building scalable, reusable components across diverse web applications.
