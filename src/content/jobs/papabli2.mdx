In my current role as Tech Lead, I lead the engineering team in evolving our system architecture and scaling our B2B platform to meet growing demands. Together with the team, I initiated the gradual decoupling of our monolith into more modular and service oriented components, applying microservice principles where they aligned with product needs. I also guided the integration of external technologies such as Python services for chatbot and in-apps messaging features, ensuring seamless communication between services.

I led the design and implementation of our cloud infrastructure on Huawei Cloud, optimizing server architecture for reliability, performance, and cost effectiveness. My Huawei Cloud Services certification supported this initiative and enabled us to adopt cloud native best practices effectively. As a team lead, I focus on aligning technical execution with business goals, facilitating Agile processes, mentoring engineers, and fostering a strong, collaborative engineering culture. I remain actively involved in high level architectural decisions and continue to contribute to key initiatives that shape our platform's future.
