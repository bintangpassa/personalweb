After my promotion to Tech Lead, I supported the company through a rapid growth phase under the strong leadership of our founder. As the business evolved beyond launch, we scaled our platform to meet increasing B2B client demands, with a growing number of companies adopting the platform despite the global challenges during the COVID-19 period.

I led a team of six engineers to extend and maintain the core Laravel-based system while progressively modularizing components into microservices to improve scalability and development agility. I also implemented performance optimizations through database indexing, query tuning, and caching strategies to ensure the platform remained fast and responsive as usage grew.

Our architecture expanded to include services such as a Python-based chatbot, an in-house CRM system, and various internal tools tailored to business operations. We deepened our partnership with Huawei Cloud while continuing our engagement with Alibaba Cloud, optimizing infrastructure for cost and reliability.

I remained actively involved in architecture planning, cross-functional coordination, and mentoring engineers, ensuring our technical direction stayed aligned with evolving business needs. Beyond engineering, I was also involved in supporting the companyâ€™s presentations to potential investors, including venture capital firms. Through this experience, I gained valuable exposure to business strategy and investor communication, broadening my perspective beyond technology and deepening my understanding of how product and business connect.
