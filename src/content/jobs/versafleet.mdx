As a Software Engineering Manager at a TMS (Transport Management System) SaaS company serving enterprise and mid-market clients across the APAC region, I lead multi-country engineering teams (Indonesia, Singapore, and the Philippines) to deliver high-performance, fault-tolerant systems built to handle high volumes of daily deliveries.

I work closely with tech leads to guide product delivery, lead team operations, mentor engineers, and facilitate Agile/Scrum processes. I collaborate cross-functionally with product, CX, and business teams to ensure smooth system integrations and alignment with business goals. These efforts are especially critical in the complex logistics environment we support.

I led the successful ISO 27001 certification initiative, embedding security and compliance into our engineering workflows. The systems we build are designed for scalability and reliability, with minimal fault tolerance, to support real-time logistics operations.

One of my key contributions was solving large-scale routing and fleet optimization challenges. We develop a route engine in Java with Jsprit Library, combining K-Means clustering, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and heuristic algorithms to manage constraints such as time windows, capacities, and dynamic rerouting. This improved delivery accuracy, reduced operational costs, and increased client satisfaction.

I also initiated the exploration of Gemini AI LLM, leading early efforts to integrate intelligent automation into our platform using Python. This included AI agents and guardrails to improve adaptability and operational efficiency. While the team led the implementation, I remained actively involved in shaping direction and ensuring it aligned with our goals for scalability and reliability.

I guide the team not only by encouraging them to grow, but also by helping them push past uncertainty when challenges feel overwhelming, and stay grounded when confidence runs high.
