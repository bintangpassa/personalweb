As a Software Engineering Manager at a TMS (Transport Management System) SaaS company serving enterprise and mid-market clients across the APAC region, I lead multi-country engineering teams (Indonesia, Singapore, and the Philippines) to deliver high-performance, fault-tolerant systems built to handle high volumes of daily deliveries.

I work closely with tech leads to guide product delivery, lead team operations, mentor engineers, and facilitate Agile/Scrum processes. I collaborate cross-functionally with product, CX, and business teams to ensure smooth system integrations and alignment with business goals. These efforts are especially critical in the complex logistics environment we support.

I led the successful ISO 27001 certification initiative, embedding security and compliance into our engineering workflows. The systems we build are designed for scalability and reliability, with minimal fault tolerance, to support real-time logistics operations.

One of my key achievements has been solving large-scale routing and fleet optimization challenges through tailored algorithmic solutions. These efforts have significantly improved delivery accuracy, reduced operational costs, and enhanced client satisfaction.

I initiated the exploration of Gemini AI implementation, including AI agents and guardrails, within our engineering team, driving efforts to bring intelligent automation into our platform. While the technical implementation is led by the team, I remain actively involved in shaping the direction and ensuring alignment with our goals for scalability and reliability. This initiative is designed to enhance system adaptability and improve operational efficiency within a high-availability SaaS environment.

I focus on fostering a culture of ownership, continuous improvement, and engineering excellence. I guide the team not only by encouraging them to grow, but also by helping them push past uncertainty when challenges feel overwhelming, and stay grounded when confidence runs high. This enables consistent delivery of impactful software at scale.
