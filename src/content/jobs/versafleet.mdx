In my role as a Software Engineering Manager, I lead a dynamic and diverse team of tech professionals to drive innovation and efficiency in Transport Management System (TMS) SaaS solutions, with a strong focus on vehicle routing optimization and last-mile delivery logistics.

My responsibilities include team leadership, facilitating Scrum ceremonies, providing technical advisory on route optimization challenges, and managing complex integrations between multiple stakeholders. I also serve as a vehicle routing consultant, ensuring our solutions leverage the best optimization techniques to improve fleet efficiency and delivery performance.

In addition to my technical and leadership responsibilities, I played a central role in overseeing and completing the ISO 27001 certification process. This included coordinating with auditors, aligning our policies and systems with compliance requirements, and ensuring that information security best practices were embedded into our engineering workflows.

A key part of my role is motivating and empowering my team to reach their full potential, fostering a culture of collaboration, inclusion, and continuous improvement.

A key achievement in my role has been solving several vehicle routing problem issues for multiple clients, significantly enhancing last-mile delivery solutions within the logistics sector. These efforts have successfully optimized thousands of deliveries per day, improving overall efficiency and customer satisfaction.
