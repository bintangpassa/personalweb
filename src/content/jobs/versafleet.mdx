In my role as a Software Engineering Manager, I lead a cross-functional team of engineers to deliver scalable SaaS solutions in the Transport Management System (TMS) domain, with a strong focus on vehicle routing optimization and last-mile logistics. I am responsible for end-to-end product delivery, from defining technical direction to ensuring execution aligned with business goals.

My role includes leading team operations, facilitating Scrum ceremonies, mentoring developers, and managing the timeline. This is especially important when addressing complex route optimization challenges and managing integrations across multiple stakeholders. I also act as a subject matter expert in vehicle routing, helping clients improve fleet efficiency through tailored algorithmic solutions.

I work closely with Product, Customer Experience (CX), and Marketing teams to ensure that our technical execution aligns with user needs, market positioning, and overall business objectives. This cross-functional collaboration helps translate feedback and strategic goals into practical, scalable features.

In addition to technical leadership, I led the successful implementation and certification of ISO 27001. This ensured that security compliance was fully integrated into our workflows and engineering practices.

One of my key achievements has been solving routing challenges for enterprise clients. These efforts have optimized thousands of daily deliveries and significantly improved operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

I am committed to empowering my team through a culture of ownership, collaboration, and continuous improvement. This approach enables engineers to grow while consistently delivering high-impact product value at scale.
