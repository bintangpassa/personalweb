At Papabili, a fast-paced B2B startup, I played a foundational role in building the companyâ€™s platform from scratch. I initiated the project by writing the first lines of code and led the design of the overall system architecture, tech stack, and infrastructure for backend, frontend, and mobile applications. I proposed React Native for the mobile apps with a Laravel-based monolithic stack with PostgreSQL and initially deployed the system on Alibaba Cloud.

I worked closely with the founder and stakeholders to translate business ideas into working software and led the product through to launch. I handled infrastructure setup, DevOps automation, CI/CD pipelines, and introduced Scrum-based workflows to support agile iteration and fast-paced delivery.

As the team expanded, I collaborated with four additional engineers, providing technical leadership and shared ownership of product delivery. My initiative in both engineering and infrastructure led to my certification as a Huawei Certified ICT Associate and my promotion to Information Techonology Lead.
