At Papabli, I served as a Senior Full Stack Engineer contributing to the development of our Laravel based monolithic B2B platform. I worked across the stack, helping to deliver business critical features while collaborating closely with teammates, product managers, and stakeholders. In addition to Laravel and PostgreSQL, I was involved in designing and co-developing key standalone components including a Python based chatbot that streamlined internal customer service workflows.

I also played a key role in setting up and managing the server infrastructure on Huawei Cloud, ensuring secure, scalable, and cost efficient deployments. This hands-on involvement with cloud infrastructure was supported by my Huawei Cloud Services certification. My contributions extended beyond development into architecture discussions, DevOps practices, and internal process improvements, which laid the foundation for my promotion to Tech Lead.
